To build the documentation, you need Metapost and XY-pic.  On Linux,
Metapost is supplied via the package texlive-metapost, and XY-pic is
supplied in package texlive-pictures.  On some older versions of
Linux, you may also have to install texlive-context.

If you want to build the documentation from the sources, and you don't
have and want to install the cmarrows package for Metapost, comment
out the line in cpsadiagrams.mp that loads cmstrands.
