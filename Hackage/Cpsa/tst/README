This directory contains the test suite for CPSA.  Files with a .scm
extension are expected to succeed, ones with a .lsp extension expected
are expected to fail, and ones with a .lisp are not run.  The .lisp
files may run for a long time and succeed or maybe they fail.  The
test suite is usually run by typing "./cpsatst" in the parent
directory.

After running the test suite, you will note files with the extension
.xhtml.  These are XHTML/SVG compound documents that can be viewed by
standards compliant browsers such as Firefox and Safari.

New users should study CPSA's analysis of the following protocols in
order, Needham-Schroeder (ns.xhtml), Woo-Lam (woolan.xhtml), Yahalom
(yahalom.xhtml), ffgg (ffgg.xhtml), and finally Otway-Rees (or.xhtml).
When studying the full output, simultaneously display the extracted
shapes.  The shapes file has an extension of _shapes.xhtml.

On the first pass, just look at the first two problems in the analysis
of the Needham-Schroeder Protocol, and return to this test case when
reading about role origination assumptions in the primer.
