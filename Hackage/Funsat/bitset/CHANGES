bitset Changelog
================

Here you can see the full list of changes between each bitset release.

Version 1.4.7
-------------

Released on August 25th, 2013

- 'GBitSet' was renamed to 'BitSet' and is now 'newtype' as suggested
  by John Ericson, see #10 on GitHub for details.

Version 1.4.6
-------------

Released on July 17th, 2013

- Fixed build issues on Windows, see #9 on GitHub for details.

Version 1.4.5
-------------

Released on June 6th, 2013

- Fixed 'Ord' instance, same bug as in 'Eq'. Where is my mind?

Version 1.4.4
-------------

Released on May 14th, 2013

- Fixed 'Eq' instance, equal sizes don't mean a thing!

Version 1.4.3
-------------

Released on May 13th, 2013

- Fixed bug with broken cabal distribution.

Version 1.4.2
-------------

- Switched to GMP bit fiddling functions, the corresponding patch for
  'integer-gmp' was submitted to GHC, see
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/7860

Version 1.4.1
-------------

Released on April 24th, 2013

- Removed 'clearBitInteger' which didn't update the size field of
  the newly created 'Integer'. Turns out it's completely non-trivial
  to implement.


Version 1.4.0
-------------

Released on April 4th, 2013

- More speed optimizations, 'Data.BitSet.Dynamic' is close to 'Data.Set'
  performance on most operations.
- Added 'Data.BitSet.Word', a bit set with native integer as container
  type, significantly faster then 'Data.Set' for enumerated types with
  small number of constructors.
- Added folds, 'map' and 'filter' for consistency with other Haskell
  containers.

Version 1.3.0
-------------

Released on March 25th, 2013

- Added a generic bit set data type, abstract with respect to the underlying
  container.
- Improved dynamic bit set performance via optimized 'popCount' and
  'testBit' functions.

Version 1.2
-----------

Initial release, released on March 22th, 2013
